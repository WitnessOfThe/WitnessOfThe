### Hi there :wave:!

I am a junior machine learning engineer looking for a job. 

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning more about machine learning and data science. I already got some experience with computer vision and image feature extraction. You can check out my rock/paper/scissor game [implementation](https://github.com/WitnessOfThe/computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors), where you can play the game with a computer using your webcam. For more real-world problems, I made a feature extraction API for building a recommendation ranking system, check it out [here](https://github.com/WitnessOfThe/facebook-marketplaces-recommendation-ranking-system).
As of now, I am actualizing my knowledge of the decision forest models and algorithms  :evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree:, to be able to create powerful pipelines for business purposes.

I am fluent in **Python** and **Matlab**; <br />
I have a good grasp of **pandas** to process the data and upload it to **PostgreSQL** database; <br />
I am familier with **Docker** and **FastAPI** enough to deploy (Operating!) container in **AWS** using **docker-compose**; <br />
I got deep into **PyTorch** to apply transfer learning to solve image classification and feature extraction problems to build the **FAISS** index, while **TensorBoard** came quite handy during model training.
